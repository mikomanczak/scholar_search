## Context

Semantic Scholar is an open-access academic search engine developed by the Allen Institute for AI. 
It helps researchers discover relevant papers and explore citations.

## Problem

Searching for scientific papers often requires trying multiple keywords or phrases. Doing this manually results in overlapping results and unnecessary duplicate papers.

## Solution

This tool automates the process by:
- Searching Semantic Scholar for each keyword
- Combining all results
- Removing duplicate papers
- Returning a single, clean list for further review
